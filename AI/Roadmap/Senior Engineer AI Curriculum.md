# 🧠 Senior Engineer AI Curriculum
_Math → Transformers → LLM Theory_

Audience: experienced software engineers who want **deep theoretical understanding** of ML and LLMs (not prompt engineering).

## Goals

- Understand the math behind neural networks
- Fully internalize softmax, cross-entropy, attention
- Read transformer papers without feeling lost
- Build a correct mental model of GPT / Claude-style models
